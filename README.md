# 🔐 Graphical Password Authentication System  

A secure authentication project developed by **Aaryan Singh Rawat** that strengthens traditional alphanumeric passwords by adding an image-based authentication layer.  

---

## 📖 Overview  
- Users create a unique graphical password by selecting images from a predefined set.  
- During login, this graphical password is combined with a standard text password.  
- This two-factor approach makes unauthorized access significantly harder.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Dual authentication (Text + Image password)  
- Enhanced security for sensitive platforms  
- User-friendly graphical interface  
- Built with the MERN stack for scalability and performance
