# Graphical Password Authentication

Graphical Password Authentication is a project developed by **Aaryan Singh Rawat** that adds an additional layer of security to traditional alphanumeric passwords by incorporating image-based authentication.

Users can create a unique graphical password by selecting images from a predefined set. This image password, when combined with a regular alphanumeric password, significantly enhances login security. The system is ideal for platforms where secure authentication is crucial—such as online banking, e-commerce, and social media.

This project is built using the **MERN stack**:
- **MongoDB** – for database management
- **Express.js** – for backend API routing
- **React.js** – for the frontend interface
- **Node.js** – as the server environment
